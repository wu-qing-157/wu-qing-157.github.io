I'm Yi Gu (顾逸, gù yì), a first year Ph.D. student at [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu) of UC San Diego.
I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu).

Prior to joining CMU, I obtained my B.E. degree at [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home),
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn) in June 2022,
advised by [Prof. Yong Yu](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu).

My research interest lies in natural language processing and machine learning.
I am currently working on designing approaches for language models to learn knowledges from specific world models.
