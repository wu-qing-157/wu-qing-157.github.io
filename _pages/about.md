I'm Yi Gu (顾逸, gù yì), a second year Ph.D. student in Data Science at [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu) of UC San Diego.
I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu).

Prior to joining UCSD, I obtained my B.ENG. degree at [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home),
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn) in June 2022,
advised by [Prof. Yong Yu](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu).

My research interest lies in foundational models and reasonings.
In particular,
I am recently working on the reasoning ability of nowadays LLMs ([RAP](#rap), [Reasoners](#reasoners)),
and also building World Models ([Pandora](#pandora)),
aiming for the next-generation machine reasoning beyond LLMs.
